    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Hey there, I'm Nick, your friendly neighborhood 37-year-old hailing from the sunny shores of Southsea in the UK. Brace yourselves, because I've decided to kick off a daring new chapter in my life â€“ a career change that promises more twists and turns than a rollercoaster at a coding theme park. Yep, you heard me right, I'm diving headfirst into the enchanting world of coding.</p>
    <p>Now, I must confess, coding has always been that elusive enigma I've longed to unravel. The kind of mystery that's more perplexing than trying to figure out why they call it "fast food" when you spend half your lunch break in the drive-thru. I mean, seriously, me and coding? It's like trying to teach a cat to salsa dance, but here I am, folks, fashioning my very first "website."</p>
    <p>For nearly half a decade, I've been the grandmaster of a Telco company, dishing out hosted Telephony services to businesses. Life was good until that pesky C19 showed up like an uninvited guest at a party, right around the two-year mark of my Telco journey. While my business is now on the mend, I thought, why not expand my horizons, learn something new, and set sail on a ship of opportunity? And what better vessel to board than the one named "full-stack developer" â€“ it checks all the boxes and more! So here's to chasing dreams and learning code â€“ may the bugs be ever in my favor! ðŸš€</p>
